NTNU-Biocore ChIP-Seq Analysis Pipeline
===================================================================


This is a plug-and-play ChIP-Seq pipeline that makes it easy to visualize your
and analyse your data. All you need to do to use it is to create a sample sheet
for your data!

Visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* create graphs such as heatmaps and profileplots
* make the data viewable in genome browsers

A great many number of ways of grouping and normalizing the data for visualization are
available.

Statistical analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* call peaks and find ChIP-enriched regions in the genome
* do statical analyses comparing different conditions

You can choose to either use MACS2 or epic (good for narrow and broad peaks,
respectively) to call peaks/enriched regions. Then these regions can be analysed
to find those peaks/enriched regions that differ between conditions.

Easy to use!
------------

All you need to do to use the pipeline is to write a sample sheet for your data
with the following columns: ``
