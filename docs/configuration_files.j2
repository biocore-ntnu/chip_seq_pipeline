Configuration files
===================

bincs requires two files to run, namely a configuration file and a
sample sheet.

A config file describes the pipeline settings, such as genome build, annotation
files and ChIP-Seq callers. The sample sheet describes the layout of your
experiment and the files which contain your biological data.

Sample sheet
------------

Let's look at the sample sheet first.

This file contains five columns: File, Name, Group, ChIP and Mate.

.. code-block:: csv

   File Name Group ChIP Mate

   download/ChIP_2_fibroblast.bed.gz fibroblast_2_ChIP fibroblast ChIP 1

   download/Input_3_keratinocyte.bed.gz keratinocyte_3_Input keratinocyte Input 1

   download/Input_2_melanocyte.bed.gz melanocyte_2_Input melanocyte Input 1
   download/Input_3_melanocyte.bed.gz melanocyte_3_Input melanocyte Input 1


* **File**

   This is the path to the ChIP-Seq file. Valid filetypes are fastq(.gz), bed/bedpe(.gz)
   and bam.

* **Name**

   This is the name of the sample the file contains.

* **Group**

   This is the group the sample belongs to. The group variable is used to denote
   which files should be analyzed together and often corresponds to an
   experimental condition, timepoint or tissue type. For example, when calling
   peaks, you do not want to call peaks for all the data pooled, but rather find
   peaks for each group, fibroblast, keratinocyte and melanocyte so that you
   know which peaks are specific to which condition.

* **ChIP**

   This variable tells whether the file is a ChIP file or an Input file. Since
   ChIP-Seq data typically contain ~90-95% noise, having a background file for
   statistical comparisons is extremely important.

   Note that there is no requirement about the number of Input files being the
   same as the number of ChIP files. Also, ChIP and Input files are not matched,
   i.e., fibroblast_1_ChIP is not matched against fibroblast_1_Input above. In
   all analyses, the background signal is pooled, since it is supposed to be
   just background noise.

* **Mate**

   Mate is used to denote whether a file contains reads from the first mate or
   second in paired end data. It is only applicable when the file format used is
   fastq.


Configuration file
------------------

The configuration file contains a wealth of variables which indicate
user-configurable settings.

{% for category, subcategory in config %}
{{ category | format_category }}

{{ subcategory.description }}
{% for key2, value2 in subcategory.items() if key2 != "description" %}

* **{{ key2 }}**

.. code-block:: yaml

   {{value2.required | required}}
   {{ key2 }}: {{ value2.default | default }}

{{ value2.description}}

{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
